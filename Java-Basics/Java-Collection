Java Collection Framework

Implementation of Data Structures :-
List : ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack
Set : HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet
Queue : LinkedList, ArrayDeque, PriorityQueue
Deque : LinkedList, ArrayDeque
Map: HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
List :
ArrayList >> Dynamic Sized Array
LinkedList >> Doubly linked list
Vector >> Dynamic Sized Array >> Legacy Class >> thread safe >> Not recommended to be used in single threaded environment cause extra overhead >> Use ArrayList
Stack >> LIFO >> extends Vector class >> Legacy Class >> thread safe >> Not recommended to be used in single threaded environment cause extra overhead >> Use ArrayDeque

Set :
HashSet >> Use hashing internally >> collection of keys >> quickly search insert delete keys >> order is not preserved 
TreeSet >> Implements Self Balancing binary search tree >> Red-Black tree >> Sorted order 
LinkedHashSet >> Internally uses HashSet and LinkedList >> Order is preserved 

Queue :
LinkedList >> FIFO >> Queue Implemented using LinkedList
ArrayDeque >> FIFO >> Queue Implemented using Array
PriorityQueue >> Implements Heap Data Structure >> Queue with Priorities

Deque :
LinkedList : Doubly ended queue >> Implemented using LinkedList
ArrayDeque : Doubly ended queue >> Implemented using Array

Map : 
HashMap : Internally uses Hashing >> Collection of Key and Value pair >> Searching O(1) avg case >> Order is not preserved 
TreeMap >> Implementation of SElf Balancing Binary Search Tree ie Red-Black Tree >> Items are stored in Sorted order >> Searching, insert delete are O(log n)
LinkedHashMap >> Order is preserved >> uses Internally uses HashMap and LinkedList

Comparable Interface >> compareTo(Object obj)
it return this.x - obj.x;
it sorts in natural order of the type defined in the compareTo method 
the class will be implementing the comparable interface 

Comparator Interface >> compare(Object obj1,Object obj2)
return obj1.x - obj2.x;
we need to create a separate class which implements the comparator interface as it does not follow the natural order 
its object is to be part in sort function or lambda function or method reference
